For Christmas Assignment to make a game, I chose to make a coded game version of the classic game nearly everyone had growing up as a kid in the 90s or early 2000s, "BopIt" as it was my favourite game as a kid growing up before I had access to consoles and PCs.
I have made the game so that Player 1 is the player bopping, if you'd like, and Player 2 is the one who decides which option player 1 must do correctly. This made the game far more enjoyable for the people I tested it with.
